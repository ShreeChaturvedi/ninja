# ninja
ninja aims to be a flexible and lightweight computer algebra system written purely in python

## Capabilities
### Numbers:
- Checking if a number is a prime
- Checking if a number is a palindrome
- Checking if a number is an armstrong
- Return the n<sup>th</sup> prime number
- Return the n<sup>th</sup> fibonacci number
- Return the name of a number
- Return the parity of a number
- Return the representation of a number in Roman numerals
- Return the representation of a number in tally bars
- Return the visualization of a number
- Convert a number from one base to another
### Plotting
- 2D and 3D function plots
- 2D and 3D quiver plots or vector plots
- 2D and 3D scatter plots
- Bar charts
- Pie Charts
- Table of values of `x` and `f(x)` given function f
- Multiple numbers on Number line

### Roots
- All roots of a smooth function in a given range `-r < x < r`
- Sum and product of the roots of a polynomial
- Degree of a polynomial

### Differentiation
Valid operators include `+ - * / ^` and valid functions include `sin cos tan cot asin acos atan ln`.
Only `x` is a valid variable and symbolic constants such as `e` are not understood.
The differentiator can also correctly apply all of the following rules:
- Power rule
- Sum rule
- Difference rule
- Product rule
- Quotient rule
- Chain rule
